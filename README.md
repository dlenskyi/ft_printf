### It's my first project in algorithm branch of school 42
ft_printf have to reproduce the same behavior as libc's printf. <br />
My ft_printf can manage %d, %D, %i, %u, %U, %s, %c, %x, %X, %o, %O, %b, %B, %f, %F, %p, %n conversions. <br />
Goes well with flags #0-+*, space and with extensions h, hh, l, ll, L. <br />
Managing wildcards and setting color to output of ft_printf. <br />
#### To run project 
* git clone https://github.com/dlenskyi/ft_printf.git
* make
* gcc main.c libftprintf.a && ./a.out <br />
Enjoy!
